Development roadmap for seambot - Architectural Seam Hygiene Auditor.

toc::[]

== Vision

Seambot aims to be the **definitive seam hygiene auditor**, ensuring architectural boundaries remain explicit, stable, and correctly exercised over time.

== Near-Term Goals (v0.2.0 - Q1 2026)

=== 1. Advanced Hidden Channel Detection

**Priority: HIGH**

* [ ] Database coupling detection (shared tables, schemas)
* [ ] Network coupling detection (cross-seam HTTP/gRPC calls)
* [ ] Environment variable coupling (shared config keys)
* [ ] Process coupling (IPC, shared memory)

**Why:** Detect all forms of hidden coupling, not just code-level.

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

=== 2. Seam Visualization

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Generate seam dependency graphs (DOT/Mermaid)
* [ ] Visualize hidden channels in diagrams
* [ ] Interactive HTML report with clickable seams
* [ ] Timeline view of seam evolution

**Why:** Make seam architecture easy to understand at a glance.

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

=== 3. Automated Seam Discovery

**Priority: LOW (Research)

* [ ] Infer potential seams from module boundaries
* [ ] Suggest seam register entries based on code structure
* [ ] Detect implicit seams (high coupling without declaration)
* [ ] Recommend seam types based on patterns

**Why:** Help teams discover their implicit architecture.

**Effort:** 4-5 weeks (research + implementation)

== Mid-Term Goals (v0.3.0 - Q2 2026)

=== 1. Cross-Repo Seam Support

**Priority: HIGH**

* [ ] Detect seams spanning multiple repositories
* [ ] Validate cross-repo conformance examples
* [ ] Track cross-repo drift
* [ ] Coordinate with git-loom for multi-repo management

**Why:** Many architectures span multiple repos.

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

=== 2. Seam Health Metrics

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Coupling score per seam (0-100)
* [ ] Seam stability index (drift frequency)
* [ ] Conformance compliance rate
* [ ] Hidden channel density

**Why:** Quantify seam health and track over time.

**Effort:** 2 weeks

=== 3. Integration with Other Bots

**Priority: HIGH**

* [ ] Coordinate with rhodibot (RSR compliance first)
* [ ] Share context with finishingbot (seam health prerequisite)
* [ ] Hypatia orchestration support
* [ ] Fleet-wide seam dashboard

**Why:** Enable multi-bot workflows for comprehensive quality.

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

=== 4. Language-Specific Analyzers

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Rust module boundaries (mod, pub, crate)
* [ ] ReScript module system
* [ ] Java package boundaries
* [ ] Python module imports
* [ ] Go package dependencies

**Why:** Better hidden channel detection for specific languages.

**Effort:** 2-3 weeks

== Long-Term Vision (v1.0.0 - Q3-Q4 2026)

=== 1. AI-Powered Seam Analysis

**Priority: RESEARCH**

* [ ] LLM-powered seam description generation
* [ ] Intelligent invariant suggestion
* [ ] Natural language seam queries
* [ ] Automated conformance example generation

**Why:** Make seam management accessible to newcomers.

**Effort:** 4-6 weeks (research + implementation)

=== 2. Architectural Patterns Library

**Priority: MEDIUM**

* [ ] Pre-defined seam patterns (Hexagonal, Onion, Clean)
* [ ] Pattern validation ("Does this match Hexagonal Architecture?")
* [ ] Pattern templates for seam registers
* [ ] Anti-pattern detection

**Why:** Help teams apply proven architectural patterns.

**Effort:** 3-4 weeks

=== 3. Seam Refactoring Assistance

**Priority: LOW (Ambitious)

* [ ] Suggest seam refactorings (split, merge, move)
* [ ] Estimate refactoring impact
* [ ] Generate migration guide for seam changes
* [ ] Safe seam boundary movement

**Why:** Make architectural evolution less risky.

**Effort:** 6-8 weeks

=== 4. Runtime Seam Validation

**Priority: RESEARCH**

* [ ] Runtime instrumentation to detect seam violations
* [ ] Dynamic hidden channel detection
* [ ] Performance impact analysis of seam crossings
* [ ] Integration with observability tools (OpenTelemetry)

**Why:** Validate seams at runtime, not just static analysis.

**Effort:** 8-10 weeks (research + implementation)

== Technical Debt

=== High Priority

* [ ] Performance optimization (parallel seam scanning)
* [ ] Memory optimization (large monorepo support)
* [ ] Better error messages (actionable suggestions)
* [ ] Improve hidden channel detection accuracy

=== Medium Priority

* [ ] Add integration tests for all seam types
* [ ] Structured logging (filterable, parseable)
* [ ] Metrics export (Prometheus format)
* [ ] Configuration validation (catch errors early)

=== Low Priority

* [ ] WASM compilation (run in browser)
* [ ] Plugin system for custom analyzers
* [ ] Alternative output formats (HTML, PDF)
* [ ] Multi-language support (i18n)

== Community Contributions Welcome

We welcome contributions in these areas:

* **Language-specific analyzers** (hidden channel detection for more languages)
* **Seam pattern libraries** (common architectural patterns)
* **Platform adapters** (Gitea, Codeberg, SourceHut)
* **Visualization tools** (better seam diagrams)
* **Documentation** (tutorials, examples, case studies)

See link:CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md] for guidelines.

== Non-Goals

Seambot will NOT:

* Auto-generate seam definitions (human judgment required)
* Infer architecture from code (explicit is better than implicit)
* Provide "AI design suggestions" (governance, not design)
* Perform cross-language semantic analysis (relies on declared boundaries)
* Mutate code (read-only auditor)

== Versioning

Seambot follows semantic versioning:

* **v0.x.y** - Pre-1.0, breaking changes allowed between minor versions
* **v1.x.y** - Stable API, breaking changes only in major versions
* **vX.0.0** - Major release with new features and possible breaking changes

== Release Cadence

* **Patch releases** (v0.1.x) - Weekly or as needed for bug fixes
* **Minor releases** (v0.x.0) - Monthly with new features
* **Major releases** (v1.0.0+) - When stable API is ready (Q4 2026 target)
